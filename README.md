This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.3.

## Generate app-routing.module.ts
* If angular project doesn't create app-routing.module.ts when a new project is created run below command on src/app folder 
* Run command ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app 
* --flat puts the file in src/app instead of its own folder.
* --module=app tells the CLI to register it in the imports array of the AppModule.
